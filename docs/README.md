## What is a plugin?
A plugin is nothing but a combination of Javascript functions that are stimulated by specifi HTTP requests. A single plugin can contain/provide as many features as you want it to have. For instance, you can write a CPU plugin that calculates the current CPU usage and returns it back to the client as a feature and have another feature (as part of that same CPU plugin) that calculates and returns the current CPU temperature.

## Philosophy
To design PiTtrol in a more organized fashion, we've decided that all plugins should take the form of a package. This includes all plugins that come included with the product. The reason behind this design decision was to ensure plugin API stability and give a first-class citizen feeling to anyone willing to write a plugin.
