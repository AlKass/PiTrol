> If you've willfully clicked here, chances are you want to build a plugin. This document shows you exactly how to do that.

## What is a plugin?
A plugin is nothing but a combination of JavaScript functions that handles a specific HTTP request. A single plugin can contain/provide as many features as you want it to have. For instance, you can write a CPU plugin that calculates the current CPU usage and returns it back to the client as a feature and another feature that calculates and returns the temperature.

## Philosophy
To design PiTtrol in a more organized fashion, we've decided that:
1. Plugins should take the form of a package.
2. All built-in features will be implemented as plugins. This ensures plugin API stability and makes contributors feel first-class citizens.
